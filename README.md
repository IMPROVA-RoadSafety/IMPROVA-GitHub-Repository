# IMPROVA-GitHub-Repository

## Overview
IMPROVA strives for a “Vision Beyond Zero” by preventing life-altering injuries related to road traffic accidents and ensuring high standards of quality of life for all road users in the long term. 

To achieve this, IMPROVA focuses on understanding and quantifying the long-term consequences (LTC) of road traffic accidents. It employs advanced tools such as virtual testing and Human Body Models to assess LTC risks for various road users, including vehicle occupants, pedestrians, powered two-wheeler (PTW) users, new mobility users, children, and standing passengers. This repository serves as a structured knowledge base for LTC research, providing resources on injury classification, assessment methods, predictive models, and intervention strategies.

## Repository Structure

- **LTC Injuries** – Categorization and descriptions of life-altering injuries.
- **LTC Glossary** – Key terms and definitions related to LTC research.
- **LTC Scales** – Standardized scales used for assessing LTC severity.
- **LTC Databases & Data Collection Methods** – Resources for data collection and analysis.
- **Assessment Procedures and Methods** – Evaluation techniques for LTC impact.
- **Models** – Predictive models and simulations for LTC risk assessment.
